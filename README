# status

should be usable, but note that especially ventisrv is subject to
a big cleanup.  other code & man pages too though.


# intro

ventisrv is a venti daemon for inferno, written in limbo.  it has
an in-memory index.  vcache is a (in-memory) venti cache.  this
package also contains simple tools to write to/read from a venti
server.

this code is the partial result of a (successful) google summer of
code 2007 project, for the project "plan 9/inferno", subproject
"ventivac".


# download

the latest version can be found at:

	http://www.ueber.net/code/r/ventisrv


# install

change mkconfig if you do not have $ROOT set.  run "mk" to compile.
create directory "/dis/venti" and run "mk install" to install.

when building from within inferno, insert SYSHOST=Inferno and ROOT=
in the mk invocations to override the values in the mkconfig.


# documentation

see the manual pages.


# licence & author

all files are in the public domain.  this code has been written by
mechiel lukkien, reachable at mechiel@ueber.net or mechiel@xs4all.nl.


# todo

- use different compression algorithm in ventisrv.  one that is
  faster (perhaps with c implementation).
- test ventisrv & vcache more.
