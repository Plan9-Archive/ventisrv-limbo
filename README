# status

should be usable, but note that especially ventisrv is subject to
a big cleanup.  other code & man pages too though.


# intro

ventisrv is a venti daemon for inferno, written in limbo.  it has
an in-memory index.  vcache is a (in-memory) venti cache.  this
package also contains simple tools to write to/read from a venti
server.

this code is the partial result of a (successful) google summer of
code 2007 project, for the project "plan 9/inferno", subproject
"ventivac".


# download

see the ventisrv homepage at http://www.ueber.net/code/r/ventisrv
for the latest version.


# install

to install, first make a file "mkconfig" similar to your inferno's
installation mkconfig (symlink/bind it).  now type "mk" to compile.
create directory "/dis/venti" and "mk install" to install.


# documentation

see the manual pages.


# licence & author

this code is released under the well-known MIT-license (the recommended
licence for participants of the "plan 9/inferno" google summer of
code 2007.  the code is written by mechiel lukkien, reachable at
mechiel@xs4all.nl or mechiel@ueber.net.


# todo

- use different compression algorithm in ventisrv.  one that is
  faster (perhaps with c implementation).
- test ventisrv & vcache more.
